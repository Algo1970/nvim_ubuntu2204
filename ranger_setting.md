### how to use

<!-- BOOKMARKS -->
<!--        Type m<key> to bookmark the current directory. You can re-enter this directory by -->
<!--        typing `<key>. <key> can be any letter or digit.  Unlike vim, both lowercase and -->
<!--        uppercase bookmarks are persistent. -->
<!--  -->
<!--        Each time you jump to a bookmark, the special bookmark at key ` will be set to the -->
<!--        last directory. So typing "``" gets you back to where you were before. -->
<!--  -->
<!--        Bookmarks are selectable when tabbing in the :cd command. -->

<!-- t-N         Open a tab. N has to be a number from 0 to 9. If the tab doesn't exist -->
<!--                      yet, it will be created. -->
<!--  -->
<!--        Alt-l, Alt-r  Shift a tab left, respectively right. -->
<!--  -->
<!--        gn, ^N        Create a new tab. -->
<!--  -->
<!--        gt, gT        Go to the next or previous tab. You can also use TAB and SHIFT+TAB -->
<!--                      instead. -->
<!--  -->
<!--        gc, ^W        Close the current tab.  The last tab cannot be closed this way. -->
